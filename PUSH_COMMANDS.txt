Once you've created the GitHub repository, run these commands:

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arabic-hex-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

OR if the repository has a different name, replace "arabic-hex-game" with your repository name.

After pushing, your repository will be at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arabic-hex-game
