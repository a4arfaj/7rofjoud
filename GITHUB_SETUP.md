# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it (e.g., `arabic-hex-game` or `7rofjoud`)
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME`):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Your Repository Link

Once pushed, your repository will be available at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
```

## Quick Setup (All in One)

If your repository is already created, just run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPO_NAME` with your repository name.
