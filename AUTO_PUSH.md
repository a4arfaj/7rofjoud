# Quick Setup - Just Need Your GitHub Username!

Your code is ready to push! I just need one thing from you:

## What I Need:
**Your GitHub username** (the one you use to sign in to github.com)

Once you give me your username, I'll:
1. ✅ Set everything up automatically
2. ✅ Push your code
3. ✅ Give you the link to your repository

## To Get Your GitHub Username:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Sign in
3. Look at the top right - your username is there
4. OR go to your profile page - the username is in the URL

## Then Tell Me:
Just say: "My GitHub username is: [your username]"

And I'll do everything else!

**Note:** You'll need to create the repository on GitHub first (I can guide you through this quickly), OR if you want, I can prepare commands that work immediately after you create it.
